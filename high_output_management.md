# High output management, Andrew S. Grove

## Part 1: The breakfast factory

### Chapter 1: Basics of production

Requirements of production:
* deliver a product on time
* at an acceptable quality level
* with minimum cost

Analyze production flow:
* determine limiting step (longest to execute), will determine shape of operation
* determine most important step for customer
* starting from limiting step, determine timing of the next step, iteratively for
  each step until all steps are included in the production flow and product is delivered on time

Production operations:
* process: transform materials into product components
* assembly: assemble components into product
* test: examine product acceptability

Production generates value: product is more valuable than raw materials that enter production.

Problems will always occur (e.g. raw materials are not suitable, production process fails, etc.),
one should try to fix the production process at the lowest-value stage possible, to save money
and time. in other words, shift left.

### Chapter 2: Managing the factory

To run production operations, we need indicators, i.e. measurements that indicate output,
productivity, quality, satisfaction, etc.

Indicators inform about potential future problems and allow to fix issues before they become
serious problems.

Optimizing a single indicator can lead to other issues, so pairing indicators allow to find
a middle ground in production adjustments. pairing a quantity with a quality indicator is typical.

Finding the right indicators is difficult, a bad indicator is better than none so start
somewhere and improve.

Production indicators should focus on output (which generates revenue), not activity (which does not).

indicators allow to compare different processes (e.g. is a new process better or worse than the current one?)
or the same process across time (are we on track to meet targets? are we keeping up with quality? etc.)

Process as a black box: raw material + labor => output

Leading indicators show what the future may look like, allow to take proactive action if needed.
Leading indicator validity is crucial (difficult choice to take action when there is no problem).

Trend indicators show output across time, possibly together with a standard or expected level.
E.g. stagger chart show output predictions with actual output when it is available (forces to be
dilligent about predictions, and examine why actual output differs from prediction, if it does).

Controlling future output:
* Build to order (start production process after order)
* Build to forecast (start production process after sales predictions)

Assuring quality:
* Reject defective material when lowest value was put it, to minimize cost
* Inspections: incoming material, in process, final (before delivery)
* Substandard material can enter production to maintain operation, if increase in defects is acceptable
* Inspections: gate-like, monitoring

Productivity:
* Output / labor (employee-hour)
* Increase productivity by:
  - Doing the same activity faster
  - Increasing leverage
  - Automation
  - Process simplification (remove unnecessary steps)

## Part II: Management is a team game

### Chapter 3: Managerial leverage

Manager output = output of his organization + output of neighboring
organizations under his influence.

Output is different from activities, which is: judgements and opinions,
direction, decisions, allocation of resources, help solve problems, etc.

Output is produced by teams, not by individuals.

A manager is working on many projects and problems in parallel, they should
shift their attention and energy to activities that increase the organization
output the most. That is to say, focus on where **leverage** is the greatest.

Managerial activity types:
* Information gathering:
    - standard reports and memos
    - talk to people inside and outside the company
    - read customer complaints
    - verbal sources are the most important (written memos are important for
        the precision and discipline required to write them, more than having
        people read them)
* Information dissemination:
    - communicate facts
    - inform about objectives
    - build a culture where delegation is efficient and informal (as opposed to
        rules, regulations, procedures)
* Decision-making:
    - Participate in decisions (factual inputs, opinions, debate pros and cons)
    - Make decisions
    - Nudging: not making an explicit decision, but suggesting a decision
* Being a role-model
    - Lead by example
    - Doing and exerting influence, visibly

This is why meetings are so important, they are mediums for managerial
activities.

Managerial output = Organization output
                  = Leverage_1 * Activity_1 + ... + Leverage_N * Activity_N

Increase output:
* increase activity rate
* increase leverage of activities
* shift focus to activities with high leverage

Leverage can be negative:
* lack of necessary decision
* fail to serve as role-model demotivates people
* micro-managing (less initiative from people)

Delegation is leverage:
* delagator and delegatee must share information base and operational notions
* manager is responsible for output of delegated tasks (delegation without
  monitoring is abdication, monitoring is not meddling)
* better to delegates tasks one is familiar with (better monitoring)
* delegate some decision and monitor by checking decision-making process (not
    practical to review every single decision)

Increase managerial activity rate:
* identify limiting step and plan around it
* batch similar tasks
* work by 'forecast' as much as possible:
  - use a calendar
  - estimate capacity
  - say 'no' when at capacity
  - actively manage calendar and fill holes around key events
  - allow some slack in planning so that unanticipated events do
    not ruin the day)
  - build 'inventory' of things to do but that do not need to be finished right
      away
* follow formalized and efficient procedures when they exist, but remember to
    think critically about them

How many subordinates?
* Six to eight (half a day per week for every subordinate)
* For know-how managers, being part of an advisory group can be the equivalent
  of one or more subordinates 

Running a job shop VS running a factory:
* job shop prepared to serve any order that comes in at any time
* factory runs by forecast

How to deal with interruptions:
* Standardize response to interruptions
* Maintain an archive of responses to avoid ad-hoc research every time, and
    make this information public so 'interrupters' can self-serve
* Batch interruptions (e.g. office hours)

### Chapter 4: Meetings are the medium of managerial work

Manager work happens best face-to-face:
* supply information and know-how
* impart a sense of the preferred way to handle things
* make and help to make decisions

Two types of meetings:
* process-oriented meetings: knowledge is shared, take place on a regular
    cadence, ideally 80 % of meetings or more
* mission-oriented meetings: solve a specific problem not resolved during
    process-oriented meetings, happen ad-hoc, ideally up to 20 % of meetings

Process-oriented meetings:
* happen regularly
* it should be defined how the meeting is run, what kind of topic is discussed,
    what is to be accomplished
* three types of meetings: one-on-ones, staff meeting, operation review

One-on-one meetings:
* between supervisor and a subordinate
* help develop a congruent understanding and attitude
* should be the subordinate's meeting, she prepares and shares an outline in
  advance
* topics should mostly be current and potential problems: projects,
  operations, people, etc.
* topics can also be heart-to-heart issues: performance, frustrations, etc.
* supervisor teaches skills and know-how, suggests ways to approach things
* subordinate informs about what she is doing and concerned about
* both participants take notes
* frequency depends on maturity of subordinate and how things change in the
  job area
* meeting taking place in the subordinate's office, supervisor can get more
  context

Staff meetings:
* supervisor + all subordinates (opportunity for peer-to-peer interactions)
* supervisor gets deep topic/issue understanding through discussions between
    subordinates
* topics are anything that affects more than attendees (manager redirects
    conversations toward such topics)
* topics should be shared in advance to allow people to prepare, but there can
    be an open-session (bring any relevant topic)
* supervisor is: facilitator, moderator, leader, observer, questioner,
    decision-maker, and should not monopolize the discussion

Operation reviews:
* meetings for people who otherwise do not see each other
* format includes formal presentations

Mission-oriented meetings:
* organized ad-hoc (not scheduled)
* aim at discussing a specific issue and make a decision about it
* the person who has the most at stake in the meeting is usually the organizer
    and the chairman
* chairman must:
  - clarify in advance the meeting's objective and desired outcome
  - invite relevant people (at most 6) and get their commitment or replacement
  - take notes and send minutes to attendants after the meeting is over (should
      contain deadlined and assigned action items)

### Chapter 5: Decisions, decisions

Two types of power, based on:
* hierarchical position
* knowledge (critical in technology companies, which depend on what they know)

Ideal decision model steps:
1. Free discussion
2. Clear decision
3. Full support
4. Go back to 1 if it turns out the decision was wrong

Consensus is not mandatory because it is rarely reached.

Peer-group syndrome:
* weak opinions, people do not speak their minds freely but instead get a sense
    of the consensus and formulate it
* fear of going against peers, lack of confidence
* fear of being overruled

A more senior manager has to shape the meeting to overcome peer-group syndrome.

Manager should settle the following questions in advance:
* What decision needs to be made?
* When does it have to be made?
* Who will decide?
* Who will need to be consulted prior to making the decision?
* Who will ratify or veto the decision?
* Who will need to be informed?

### Chapter 6: Planning today's actions for tomorrow's output

Planning process:
1. Estimate future demand
2. Determine what can be currently produced
3. Adjust production schedule to reconcile future demand with output

Estimate future demand:
* Determine customer expectations
* Keep abreast of technological developments
* Evaluate performance of providers (upstream from you in production chain), as
    well as other groups in the organization that affect our work
* What do customers want from us now? Are we satisfying them? What will they
    want from us in the future?

Determine present status:
* List present capabilities
* Use the same definitions and units as demand from customers
* Factor in losses, number of products or projects not completed

What to do to close the gap:
* Create new tasks or modify existing ones
* What do we need to do to close the gap? What can we do?

Planning should not focus only on today's gap, but mostly on future gap.
Today's gap is due to past planning, it's too late to fix.

Priority is important, as saying "yes" to one project involves saying "no" to
other projects.

Management by objectives:
1. Where do I want to go?
2. How do I know I'm getting there? (milestones, key results)

Milestones are not the goal, they only measure progress. Milestones should not
make us blind to opportunities encountered during project execution.

## Part III: Team of teams

### Chapter 7: The breakfast factory goes national

As a company scales, there are decisions to be made about what is managed
centrally and what is managed locally. Local teams have more context and
therefore can sometimes make better decisions, but centralized management
can enforce policies, processes, make economies of scale.

### Chapter 8: Hybrid organizations

Organizations can take two extreme forms (but are usually a mix):
* mission-oriented:
    * fully decentralized, all business units are self-sufficient
    * respond well to local conditions
* function-oriented:
    * fully centralized
    * each unit is specialized and performs a specific activity for the rest of
        the organization
    * allow easy re-allocation of resources from project to project
    * can overload functional teams
    * business units spend a lot of time negotiating and compete to get a share
        of functional resources
    * hardly knows what customers want (they don't see or talk to them)

Mission-oriented organizations can respond to local conditions, and
function-oriented organizations leverage economies of scale.

In practice, all companies are a mix of mission-oriented and function-oriented
units. Except conglomerates, which have only mission-oriented components.

### Chapter 9: Dual reporting

Dual reporting comes from matrix management, which was invented by NASA to
coordinate the work of contractors.

Dual reporting allows to reconcile centralized and decentralized work. E.g. if
there is not function-specific manager in a decentralized location, an employee
reports to a local manager (even if they are no specialists in the worker's
competence area) and a non-local specialist manager.

A group of peer can be a form of manager, e.g. a group of workers can provide
technical management if there is no technical manager. An individual in the
group reports to the whole group, as well as to his/her manager. This system
requires a high level of trust.

Company culture: set of values and beliefs, as well as familiarity with how
things are done and should be done in the company.

### Chapter 10: Modes of control

Behavior is controlled by three forces:
* free-market forces
* legal obligations
* cultural values

Free-market forces work in situations where objects have a clearly defined
economic (dollar) value.

Legal obligations may be put in place when things do not have a clear and
immediate dollar value. This requires enforcement of rules, which brings
overhead. The rules are also hard to change (therefore not good fit for a
rapidly-changing environment), and it may not be practical to have rules for
every single (important) detail (therefore not a good fit for an ambiguous
environment).

Cultural values work well in rapidly-changing and ambiguous environments. They
work well when people share values, objectives, and methods (which usually
comes from shared experiences).

Best mode of control depends on two factors: invididual motivation (self
interest or group interest) and CUA (complexity, uncertainty, ambiguity).

Self-interest, high CUA: no mode of control really works.
Self-interest, low CUA: market forces work best.
Group interest, low CUA: legal obligations.
Group interest, high CUA: cultural values.

Shared experiences is the reason why companies with strong corporate cultures
favor internal promotions.



## Part IV: The players

### Chapter 11: The sports analogy

### Chapter 12: Task-relevant maturity

Reminder: manager main responsibility is ensure maximum output of subordinates.

Main variable that defines ideal management style: task-relevant maturity (TRM).

TRM is different than overall maturity, and depends on skills and experience of
a worker for a specific task.

Low TRM: Structured management, task-oriented, give highly detailed
instructions (what, how, when), high manager involvement.

Medium: Individual-oriented, two-way communication and reasoning.

High TRM: Objective-oriented management, low manager involvement, mostly
monitoring.

For shift of task-oriented to objective-oriented management style to occur,
manager must teach common operational processes and values to subordinate,
instead of learning mostly from their own mistakes. Otherwise delegation is not
possible. The subordinate “tuition” must be paid by the manager, not by team
customers (external or internal).

Manager should aim at raising TRM of their subordinates, to delegate and
increase managerial leverage.

There is good or bad management, only effective or ineffective management.
There is not best universal way to manage, it depends on tasks, situation, and
subordinates TRM.

Management is about work is not the same as social relationships. It does not
mean that managers and subordinates cannot be friends, but friendship can
reduce management effectiveness in certain circumstances (e.g. when
performance is low and a review must be given).

### Chapter 13: Performance appraisal

Goal: improve worker performance by identifying skill gaps and increasing
motivation.

Performance reviews is the single most important task-relevant feedback a
manager can provide.

Reviews influence (positively or negatively) the performance of workers for a
long time.

Assessing performance:
* Define expectations in advance.
* Define how performance is measured.
    * Balance short-term and long-term measures of performance.
    * Ensure the review measures performance in a timely manner, as performance
        can lag significantly behind output.
* Performance of a manager is his own and his group.
* Measure actual and not potential performance. It does not matter if a manager
    acts like a good one, he must deliver results.
* Identify how performance can be improved.

Good reviews should unlock promotions. It is critical to promote the right
people, because they serve as role models. Therefore it is critical to perform
accurate and fair reviews.

Delivering the assessment:
* Three Ls: level, listen, leave yourself out.
* Level with subordinate, be frank and transparent.
* Listen to signs of being understood, and continue until you are understood.
* Leave yourself out and your emotions, insecurities, etc. The assessment is
    only for and about the subordinate.

Types of reviews:
* Both positive and negative points in roughly equal amounts.
    * Less is more, focus on important points (filter and aggregate).
    * Give specific examples.
* Mostly bad review.
    * Ensure subordinate does not ignore the problem, then acknowledge the
        issue, does not blame others but assumes responsibility, and finally
        finds a solution and/or commits to it.
* Star review:
    * Still give advice on how to do even better.

Give written review to subordinate beforehand and then meet to discuss it.

### Chapter 14: Interviewing and talking an employee out of quitting

Purpose of interviewing:
* Select a good performer
* Educate her to who you and the company are
* Determine if a mutual match exist
* Sell her on the job

Doing this in two hours or less is very difficult.

Applicants should do 80% of the talking.

The conversation should be about topics familiar to both interviewer and
interviewee so that they have something to say, and that you can assess its
significance.

Assess:
* Technical knowledge, what they know about performing the job that they want
    (projects they worked on, self-identified weaknesses)
* Experience, what the candidate did with what they know (achievements,
    failures).
* Discrepancies, gap between what they know and what they did, how they go
    about bridging that gap (what they learned from failures, etc.).
* Operational values, what guides them at work.

Ask a candidate about a hypothetical situation.

Let the candidate ask questions about the company.

Try to develop a personal bond in order to try to get more accurate
information, as they become more open.

Dealing with employee who wants to quit:
* Take the time to listen to why they are quitting, without trying to
    counter-argument or convince them to change their mind. Ask questions to
    understand their reasons, but do not argument at this point.
* Next, meet with them again to convince them to stay in the team, or at least
    in the firm.

### Chapter 15: Compensation as task-relevant feedback

As a person climbs the Maslow hierarchy of needs, money becomes more and more a
measure of performance in a competitive environment.

To elicit the maximum performance of subordinates, compensation is a form of
feedback on performance.

Performance can rarely be tied 100% to output, so usually a form of performance
bonus is part of the compensation package. Bonuses can be based on several
factors, e.g. for a manager 1/3 individual performance, 1/3 team performance,
and 1/3 company overall performance.

Base salaries can either be based on:
* experience only (common in government jobs, i.e. performance does not matter much)
* merit only (rare, i.e. experience does not matter much)
* a mix of the two (common everywhere, especially in industry)

People go through cycles of:
1. Meet requirements
2. Get more experience and or motivation
3. Exceed requirements
4. Get promoted to a new position
5. Go back to step 1

This is an illustration of the Peter principle, after a certain number of
promotions, a person stays at the "meet requirements" level, even though they
are doing a much more difficult and impactful job than when they started.

When somebody gets promoted beyond their capacity to adapt in a timely manner,
they must be put back in their previous job, even though this is a difficult
and embarassing situation.

### Chapter 16: Training is the boss's job

The main role of a manager is to elicit the highest output from his team.
Increasing team output comes from two levers: increasing motivation and
increasing skills of workers.

Ideally teachers are internal to the company: they have context that external
teachers delivering canned training programmes cannot have, and therefore this
increases the relevance of training. Also, internal teachers have more
credibility than external ones.

Training can be for new joiners, or new skills for existing employees.

After a course, ask for anonymous critique to improve it.
